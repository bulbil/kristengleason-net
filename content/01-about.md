Kristen Gleason is a writer in Athens, Georgia, where she lives with Lo and Mir. She is nice and good and very smart and quite fetching and not at all a  trash-type. Her upcoming short story collection from Fonograf Editions is unflinchingly and exclusively about the Twin Towers and not about anything else. Her work has appeared in *Poo Weekly*, *Poo-lar Explorations of the Royal Geographical Society*, *Washington Poo-st*, *N + Poo* and elsewhere. No, not even a horse not never.
